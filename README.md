# Fdf
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For
example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a
prerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these
phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared.
Itâ€™s your turn today to modelize in 3D some magnificent landscapes, imaginary or
not...
